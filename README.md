Collecting solutions to Advent-of-Code exercises. Structure and runtime heavily influenced by [gh:codemicro/adventOfCode](https://github.com/codemicro/adventOfCode)

## Usage

> **Note**  
> Dependencies have not been documented. It's an exercise for the reader at this time.

Using `go run . -y <year> -d <day> -i <language>` will prompt for which year/day/language to run. Additional flags are available to allow you to limit to test-only or benchmark execution.

Passing `-h` or `--help` will output the application help information.

## Building

If you prefer to build the main application instead of running `go run .`, that will work just as well and will generate wrappers and execute exercise solutions just fine.

## Generating Boilerplate

> **Warning**  
> The scripts query the Advent of Code site for some data and will require having a session token stored in `~/.config/aocd/token` Getting your session token is easily searched for online.

Run `./add_exercise.sh <year> <day>` to generate the necessary file structure and save your personal input file to the exercise.

## Generating Graphs

Benchmark files must be generated before trying to create yearly graphs. The `-b` file will provide what is needed; though it needs to be run for each exercise individually.

> **Warning**  
> An exercise with a 2-second runtime will take approximately an hour to run with default settings. Use the `-b -n <num>` flags to adjust as needed.

Graphs are generated by running the included script as such (your command may need to be slightly different):

```sh
> # create run-times.png at the path specified for all available 2022 solutions
> python3 generate_benchmark_graph.py exercises/2022/run-times.png 2022
```
